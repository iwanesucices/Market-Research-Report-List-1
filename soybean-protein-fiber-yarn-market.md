<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soybean Protein Fiber Yarn Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet-Spun Soy Fiber Yarn</li><li>Dry-Spun Soy Fiber Yarn</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The soybean protein fiber yarn market is divided into two primary types: wet-spun and dry-spun soy fiber yarn. Wet-spun soy fiber yarn is produced through a process involving the dissolution of soy protein in a solvent, resulting in a softer and more absorbent yarn, ideal for textile applications. Conversely, dry-spun soy fiber yarn uses a dry spinning process that yields a stronger, more durable yarn with a slightly textured surface. Both types offer eco-friendly alternatives to synthetic fibers, appealing to sustainable fashion trends.</p></p>
